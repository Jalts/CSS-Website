<h1>What Is CSS?</h1>
<div id=div4>CSS is short for "Cascading Style Sheets". This a style sheet language which can be used to create template
designs for websites. This can be used in HTML in order to style the website depending on the tag that the style is assigned to.
The design includes aspects like layout, colour and fonts.</div>

<h1>Why should it be used?</h2>
<div id=div4>CSS should be used coupled with HTML in order to stylise your websites. Using CSS makes it a lot easier to maintain your website,
due to the fact that you can edit your CSS and it will affect the entirety of your website. CSS is often used within HTML because they go hand in hand. 
HTML is used to define the content of your website, while CSS is used to define the documents style.</div>

<h1>How do HTML files access CSS?</h1>
<div id=div5> There are 3 main types of ways that HTML files access CSS.
<ul>
	<li>Inline - This is where the CSS is located before the item in the body, only stylising a single item.</li>
	<li>Header - This is where the CSS stylisation is located in the head tag of the page using the "style" tag. This will affect the whole page.</li>
	<li>External. - This is where the CSS is located within a separate external document and you can give items in your page the style by adding the relevant tags.</li>
</ul>
All three of these methods allow your HTML code to utilise the CSS style that you define and make it easy for you to stylise your page.
