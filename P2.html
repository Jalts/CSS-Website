<h2>What is The Box Model?</h2>
<div id=div6>The Box Model is a very important part of HTML and CSS. In terms of CSS, the Box Model is used for design and layout.
the Box Model is what we call a box that wraps around each HTML item on your webpage. I used it a lot in this website in order to 
display all of my text.

There are 4 different elements to it:
<ul>
	<li>Margins - Transparent space around the box used to distance the element from other HTML elements</li>
	<li>Borders - The outside edge of the box, encasing the padding and content</li>
	<li>Padding - Transparent space around the content used to distance the border from the content</li>
	<li>Content - Where all of the text and images are found in the element</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we can see the CSS style setting for a Box Model. Inside it, we define the margin, border and padding size in order to determine the look of our box.</p>
