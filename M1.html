<h3>What is External CSS?</h3>
<div id=div7>
External CSS is a method of accessing CSS inside of a HTML document. With External CSS, you create a whole new file to hold your CSS.
This enables you to be able to give each styling a tag so that you can apply it to whichever element you want, potentially editing your whole website
with one change to your CSS. External CSS also has the added benefit of making your HTML look very tidy as there isn't any styling parameters everywhere.</p>

<img src="externalcss.png" height="600" width="200"style="float: left;"><p>
This is part of the External CSS that I created in order to make this website. You can see that each tag has its own style that I have set, including background
colour and font. If I were to change "h2" for example, then it would change that tag across all the pages that use "h2". If I were to change the font of the heading, all 
of the elements which use "h2" would have a different font, as an example. This is just a very simple example of the things that you can do with CSS, a more advanced technique
could be the use of a hover style for when your mouse hovers over an element.

External CSS is the most common way of using CSS as it is simple, tidy and easy to read. Being able to reuse the styles that you create is very useful and allows you to create a
great looking website with minimal effort after your styles are configured correctly.

<h3>What is Header CSS?</h3>
<div id=div7>
<p>Header CSS is a method of accessing CSS within a HTML document by keeping it all in the head tag. This is an embedded type of CSS which overrides external CSS that the 
document uses. Having the CSS within the head tags of your page will give that page the style that you choose, however in order to give other pages that style, you will
have to copy that style and place it within the other webpage's head tag. This way to access CSS within HTML is very useful if you want specific elements on your webpage
to have a specific style as it will override the external CSS that it is using.</p></div>

<div id=div9>
<img src="headercss.png" style="float: left;">
<p>This is an example of some very simple Header CSS. Here we can see the style tags within the head tags, showing that the style will only be for that webpage and will not affect the 
rest of the website. This is important as if you wanted to give "h1" that colour and margin, then you would have to re write this piece of CSS in order to make it that style on a
different webpage.

<h3>What is Inline CSS?</h3>
<div id=div7>
<p>Inline CSS is a method of access CSS within a HTML document by keeping it all in the HTML element code. This is a suitable method of accessing CSS if you want to stylise just one element, 
without changing any other elements. However this method of CSS is not preferable most of the time due to the fact that when you can use it, it is almost always better to use other types of CSS 
as it will be more efficient and much tidier in terms of reading your code. Using Inline can make your code very difficult to read as it requires you to make a new style for every element on your page.

<div id=div10>
<img src="inlinecss.png" style="float: top;">
<p>This is an example of Inline CSS with a paragraph element. This would give the text within the paragraph a font size of 14 and be the colour purple. This would override any CSS that is given to the p tag.</p>
